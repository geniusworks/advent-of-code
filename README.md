# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event where programmers and coders come together to solve a series of programming puzzles and challenges. The event takes place every year in December and features 25 days of challenges, one for each day leading up to Christmas.

## Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to each day's challenge, written in PHP. Each solution is contained in a separate file or directory, labeled by day number (e.g. `01`, `02`, etc.).

## Running the Solutions

To run any of the solutions, simply navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the solution file from a command line: `php solve.php` (input.txt data not included here, per AOC policy)

My solutions are dedicated to the public domain under the CC0 1.0 Universal license.
